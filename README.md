# Logistic Regression Implementation

This repository contains Python code for implementing Logistic Regression, covering key steps such as data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The code demonstrates how to use this algorithm for classification tasks with real-world datasets.

## Contents

### 1. Code 1: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification
**Features:**
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Utilize datasets like `train.csv` and `test.csv` for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature scaling for optimization.
- **Visualization**:
  - Distribution plots for target classes.
  - Feature correlation heatmaps.
- **Model Building**: Using `sklearn` to train a logistic regression model for binary classification.
- **Prediction and Evaluation**:
  - Generating predictions for the test set.
  - Evaluating performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
  - Visualizing the confusion matrix.

### 2. Code 2: Logistic Regression with Real-World Dataset
**Dataset**: [Insert dataset name, e.g., `Social_Network_Ads.csv` or similar]  
**Objective**: Predict a binary outcome (e.g., whether a user purchases a product) based on key features:  
  - Age  
  - Estimated Salary  
  - Other relevant features  

**Workflow**:
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Cleaning and preparing features.
  - Splitting data into training and test sets.
  - Scaling features for better model convergence.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
  - Identifying patterns and visualizing relationships between features.
- **Model Training**:
  - Building a logistic regression model with `sklearn`.
  - Tuning hyperparameters for improved performance.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Assessing performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
  - Visualizing results with detailed charts and plots.
